Final Project — Single-Page Website (HTML, CSS, JS)
Overview

This project is a fully custom single-page website built using semantic HTML, organized CSS, and JavaScript written entirely from scratch. It showcases interactive front-end development skills through the use of jQuery UI, AJAX/API integration, Web Storage, and a custom image carousel. The site is designed to function as a portfolio-ready example for job applications and future professional work.

01 — Project Requirements
Core Technical Requirements

Single-page site displayed at 1280px width

Must visually resemble a real, professional website

No placeholder text or low-quality assets

Semantic, well-structured HTML

Clean, valid CSS

No console errors

async or defer applied to script tags

"use strict" applied globally

All files organized, indented, and commented

All code written entirely by me

Any JavaScript in production must be obfuscated before hosting

Required Interactive Features
jQuery Plugin/Widget

At least one jQuery UI widget (tabs, accordion, etc.).

AJAX / API

A section that loads content dynamically from:

A third-party API or

A JSON file created manually

Minimum of three pieces of content displayed.

Web Storage

Use sessionStorage or localStorage to:

Save user data

Retrieve and display saved data on page load

Slideshow / Carousel

A JavaScript or jQuery-based image carousel featuring at least three images.

02 — Project Direction & Inspiration
Concept

I built a fictional skateboarding trick showcase site that demonstrates:

API-driven content

User customization via Web Storage

jQuery UI for structured information

A custom, minimalistic image carousel

The topic supports rich visuals and interactivity while aligning with front-end development work that I may present to employers.

03 — Project Goals
Purpose of the Site

Demonstrate full front-end development competency

Showcase interaction design and JavaScript functionality

Present a polished, modern layout

Provide an engaging user experience with real-world UI features

Intended Users

Employers reviewing examples of my work

Recruiters evaluating code quality

General viewers exploring the project

What the Site Communicates

Clean code organization

Ability to build dynamic, interactive UI

Knowledge of third-party APIs

Competent visual layout and component design

04 — Process & Development
Discovery & Content Planning

Interpreted assignment requirements

Selected a topic suited to API content and interactivity

Gathered all required copy, assets, and visual materials

Created a content map to define page structure

Wireframes / Mockups

(Add your images to the repository if needed)
Created wireframes defining:

Header, hero, and navigation flow

Carousel placement

Accordion content structure

API-driven gallery

Footer section

Design Phase

Design priorities:

Readability and contrast

Simplified layouts

Scalable Flexbox/Grid sectioning

Dark, cinematic background with bright photo assets

Minimal UI chrome

Coding the Site
HTML

Semantic structure: header, nav, main, section, article, footer

Clean indentation and meaningful classes

CSS

Structured by page sections

Included styles for:

Accordion

Carousel

Trick cards

Layout spacing / utility classes

Considered small-screen behavior where needed

JavaScript

"use strict"; globally

AJAX API retrieval + DOM injection

jQuery UI accordion

Session Storage for “favorite tricks”

Custom slideshow with prev/next controls

Testing

Validated HTML and CSS

Zero console errors

Verified Web Storage persistence

Verified accordion behavior

Ensured API content loaded correctly

Tested carousel navigation reliability

05 — Tools & Resources

06 — Reflection & Next Steps
What I Learned

Integrating external APIs into UI layouts

Better DOM manipulation and event-driven coding

Organizing larger JS files

Structuring a page like a real production website

Using jQuery UI and Web Storage effectively

Challenges

Finding a stable free API

Solving z-index issues with jQuery UI

Matching CSS spacing to wireframes precisely

Future Improvements

Full mobile responsiveness

A modal detail view for each trick

More advanced carousel transitions

Content filters driven by API data

Additional animations and micro-interactions

07 — Conclusion

This project demonstrates complete front-end development skills, including planning, design, JavaScript interactivity, UI integration, and documentation. It now serves as a strong portfolio piece and an example of my ability to build polished, functional web experiences from scratch.
